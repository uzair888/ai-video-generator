A professional young woman in her late 20s is working in a modern office. She’s dressed in business casual attire, seated at her desk with a laptop open in front of her. Only one of her hands is visible—resting on the keyboard or holding a pen over a notebook—while the other is naturally out of frame. The office is softly lit with natural light, featuring subtle modern decor and a plant in the background. Her face shows natural, subtle expressions—calm focus, a thoughtful glance upward, or a gentle smile. She should look like a real person, not AI-generated—realistic skin texture, natural eye contact, and believable proportions, captured as if in a candid, professional setting.
A young woman in her mid-20s is sitting comfortably in the passenger seat of a parked car. She’s wearing a casual grey hoodie and jeans, relaxed and smiling slightly, as if waiting for a friend or enjoying a quiet moment. The car interior is clean and well-lit by soft daylight streaming through the windows. Her posture is natural, her expression calm and warm—she occasionally glances out the window or adjusts her hair casually. The atmosphere should feel candid and real, capturing a genuine slice of everyday life, not artificial or overly posed.
